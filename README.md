# Facial Expression Detection Using CNN

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting facial expressions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc.) using a **basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The goal is to classify emotions from facial images, making it suitable for applications in human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and more.

---

## Features
- **Emotion Detection**: Classifies facial expressions into predefined categories.
- **Custom Dataset**: Trained on publicly available datasets for facial expressions.
- **Lightweight CNN Model**: Implements a basic CNN architecture for ease of understanding and efficiency.
- **Expandable Framework**: Can be further extended with more complex architectures or additional datasets.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.8)
- pip
- GPU with CUDA (optional for faster training and inference)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-expression-detection-cnn.git
cd facial-expression-detection-cnn
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

### Dataset Preparation
1. Download a **Facial Expression Dataset** (e.g., FER2013, CK+).
2. Organize the dataset into training, validation, and test sets:
   ```
   dataset/
   ├── train/
   │   ├── happy/
   │   ├── sad/
   │   ├── angry/
   │   ├── surprised/
   │   └── neutral/
   ├── val/
   │   ├── happy/
   │   ├── sad/
   │   ├── angry/
   │   ├── surprised/
   │   └── neutral/
   └── test/
       ├── happy/
       ├── sad/
       ├── angry/
       ├── surprised/
       └── neutral/
   ```

## Training

### Model Architecture
The CNN architecture includes:
- **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction
- **Pooling Layers**: For dimensionality reduction
- **Fully Connected Layers**: For classification

### Training the Model
To train the model, run the following:
```bash
python train.py --dataset dataset/ --epochs 25 --batch_size 32 --lr 0.001
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `--dataset`: Path to the dataset folder
  - `--epochs`: Number of training epochs
  - `--batch_size`: Batch size for training
  - `--lr`: Learning rate

---

## Inference

To run inference on an image:
```bash
python predict.py --model path/to/model.h5 --image path/to/image.jpg
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `--model`: Path to the trained model file
  - `--image`: Path to the input image

The output will display the predicted emotion along with the confidence score.

---

## Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance on the test set:
```bash
python evaluate.py --model path/to/model.h5 --dataset dataset/test/
```
- Displays metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

---

## Deployment

### Streamlit Web App
Deploy a simple web-based demo using **Streamlit**:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Flask API
Run a Flask server for integration with other systems:
```bash
python app.py
```
